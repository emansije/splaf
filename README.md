Splaf stands for Structured Programming Language And Flowcharts. It is a tool to aid students of Computer Sciences courses who are in their first year of a programming class. This first implementation is demoed with a Portuguese grammar, but other grammars can be used.

Splaf is a web application that runs mainly in JavaScript. Included is a demo web server in Python.

The application window is divided in two halves, one for the structured programming language code (SPLC) and the other for the corresponding flowchart. The first implementation converts the SPLC into a flowchart that is slightly interactive, but a future implementation should have editing tools to allow the user to build the flowchart and then generate the corresponding SPLC.
